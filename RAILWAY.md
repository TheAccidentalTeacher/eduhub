# Railway Deployment Guide for EduCraft Worksheet Generator

## Quick Railway Deployment

### 1. Connect Repository to Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose your `eduhub` repository

### 2. Environment Variables
Add these environment variables in Railway dashboard:

**Core Required:**
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Your OpenAI API key (starts with `sk-`)

**AI Image Generation (Recommended):**
- **STABILITY_AI_API_KEY**: Stability AI key for high-quality educational diagrams

**Optional Enhancements:**
- **PEXELS_API_KEY**: For stock photos
- **PIXABAY_API_KEY**: For additional stock images  
- **UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY**: For professional stock photos
- **YOUTUBE_API_KEY**: For educational videos
- **NEWS_API_KEY**: For current events integration
- **GIPHY_API_KEY**: For educational GIFs

> **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip**: The system uses intelligent image selection - DALL-E/Stability AI for custom content, stock photos for real-world items. Without these keys, it falls back to curated educational images.
